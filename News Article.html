        <h1>'What a joke': Pak lawmaker mocks 'salesman' Munir's rare earth display for Trump; gives dire warning</h1>

        <p>Pakistani senator Aimal Wali Khan sharply criticised Pakistan Army chief Asim Munir for showing rare earth minerals to US President Donald Trump, questioning in what official capacity Munir was showcasing them.
Khan said, “Our chief of army staff is roaming around with a briefcase containing rare earth minerals. What a joke! It was absolute mockery. Whoever saw that photo thought, ‘Which chief of the army staff would go around carrying a briefcase with rare earth minerals?’ To me, it looked like a big, branded store – a manager watched on happily as a shopkeeper tells a customer to purchase a big, glittery thing from him.”</p><br>
<p>He added, "In what capacity? Under which law? This is dictatorship. I'm sorry to say this is not democracy...is not the contempt of parliament?"<br>

Earlier, Khan had likened Munir presenting rare earth minerals to Trump to an "elite designer shop," highlighting his skepticism over the field marshal's involvement in matters relating to strategic resources.</p>
<br>
<p>A photograph shared by the White House from the recent US tour of Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif showed Munir presenting a wooden box containing rare earth minerals to Trump in the Oval Office.<br>
This was Munir's third visit since May's Pakistan-India conflict, which Trump has repeatedly claimed he helped end. Pakistan has even nominated him for the Nobel Prize for allegedly mediating the truce. However, New Delhi denies Trump's involvement, stating that ceasefire discussions were a bilateral matter with Islamabad.<br>
Pakistan had requested India for a ceasefire on May 10, after four days of cross-border clashes following India's Operation Sindoor in response to the April 22 Pahalgam attack, which killed 26 civilians.</p>
